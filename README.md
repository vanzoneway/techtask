# Completed test task

## Note

The assignment has been completed strictly according to the technical requirements and nothing extra has been added, but in my opinion I would have added SWAGGER documentation, exception handling through RestController, logging through AOP and the like. You can find such projects on my GitHub, I didn't do that here, since I would have had to rewrite the controllers a bit, and the conditions don't allow that. This information is for those checking the assignment.
